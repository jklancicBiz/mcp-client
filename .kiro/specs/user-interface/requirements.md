# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The MCP Agent currently operates as a command-line interface (CLI) application that connects to MCP servers with pluggable LLM backends. This feature aims to enhance the MCP Agent by adding a graphical user interface (GUI) that provides a more intuitive and user-friendly way to interact with the agent, configure settings, and visualize tool interactions.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user, I want a graphical interface for the MCP Agent so that I can interact with it more intuitively without using the command line.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application is launched THEN the system SHALL display a graphical user interface.
2. WHEN the user interacts with the GUI THEN the system SHALL provide the same functionality as the CLI version.
3. WHEN the user types a message in the chat input THEN the system SHALL send it to the agent and display the response.
4. WHEN the agent is processing a request THEN the system SHALL display a loading indicator.
5. WHEN the agent encounters an error THEN the system SHALL display an appropriate error message.

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want to see the conversation history in a clear and organized way so that I can review past interactions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user sends a message THEN the system SHALL add it to the conversation display with appropriate styling.
2. WHEN the agent responds THEN the system SHALL add the response to the conversation display with distinct styling.
3. WHEN a tool is used THEN the system SHALL indicate this in the conversation with details about the tool call.
4. WHEN the conversation history becomes long THEN the system SHALL provide scrolling capabilities.
5. WHEN the application is restarted THEN the system SHALL provide an option to view previous conversation sessions.

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want to configure the MCP Agent settings through the GUI so that I don't need to edit configuration files manually.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user accesses settings THEN the system SHALL display a configuration interface.
2. WHEN the user changes LLM provider settings THEN the system SHALL update the configuration accordingly.
3. WHEN the user changes MCP server settings THEN the system SHALL update the configuration accordingly.
4. WHEN the user saves settings THEN the system SHALL persist them to the configuration file.
5. WHEN the application starts THEN the system SHALL load the saved configuration.
6. WHEN API keys are entered THEN the system SHALL store them securely.

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want to see available MCP tools and resources in the interface so that I know what capabilities are available.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN connected to an MCP server THEN the system SHALL display a list of available tools.
2. WHEN a tool is selected THEN the system SHALL display details about the tool including its description and parameters.
3. WHEN connected to an MCP server THEN the system SHALL display a list of available resources.
4. WHEN a resource is selected THEN the system SHALL display details about the resource.
5. WHEN the list of tools or resources changes THEN the system SHALL update the display accordingly.

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user, I want to manage multiple MCP server connections so that I can switch between different tool sets easily.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user adds a new MCP server configuration THEN the system SHALL save it to the configuration.
2. WHEN the user selects a different MCP server THEN the system SHALL connect to it and update the available tools and resources.
3. WHEN the user removes an MCP server configuration THEN the system SHALL remove it from the configuration.
4. WHEN a connection to an MCP server fails THEN the system SHALL display an appropriate error message and fallback options.
5. WHEN multiple MCP servers are configured THEN the system SHALL allow the user to select which one to connect to.

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a user, I want the GUI to be responsive and work across different operating systems so that I can use it on my preferred platform.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application is run on Windows THEN the system SHALL display correctly and function properly.
2. WHEN the application is run on macOS THEN the system SHALL display correctly and function properly.
3. WHEN the application is run on Linux THEN the system SHALL display correctly and function properly.
4. WHEN the window is resized THEN the system SHALL adapt the layout appropriately.
5. WHEN the application is used on a high-DPI display THEN the system SHALL scale appropriately.

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a user, I want to export and import conversation history so that I can save important interactions or share them with others.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user chooses to export a conversation THEN the system SHALL save it to a file in a standard format.
2. WHEN the user chooses to import a conversation THEN the system SHALL load it from a file and display it.
3. WHEN a conversation is exported THEN the system SHALL include all messages, tool calls, and results.
4. WHEN the user wants to share a conversation THEN the system SHALL provide options to copy or save the content.
